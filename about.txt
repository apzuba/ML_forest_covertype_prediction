1. Load the Covertype Data Set○ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype
2. Implement a very simple heuristic that will classify the data○ It doesn't need to be accurate
3. Use Scikit-learn library to train two simple Machine Learning models○ Choose models that will be useful as a baseline
4. Use TensorFlow library to train a neural network that will classify the data○ Create a function that will find a good set of hyperparameters for the NN○ Plot training curves for the best hyperparameters
5. Evaluate your neural network and other models○ Choose appropriate plots and/or metrics to compare them
6. Create a very simple REST API that will serve your models○ Allow users to choose a model(heuristic, two other baseline models, or neural network)○ Take all necessary input features and return a prediction
